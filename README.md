# Simony_Kingdom

The idea of this game is to have all free to play players start as serfs that farm or do some other menial labor.
To progress in the human hierarchy the player has to give money to "God" or in other words the game.
In giving of money the players position improves and he gains abilities/powers.
The more money one gives the more power they have over those below them.
